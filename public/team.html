              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>
                Born in London, 1993, Jackie has always been driven by
                creativity. When she is not running the creative workshops you
                will find her in her studio painting, tinkering with her old
                Yamaha motorbike, or cooking for the masses at some kind of
                village charity event. You often hear her say, “Oh, why did I
                agree to do this?”. A little known fact about Jackie is her
                passion for milk bottles. She started collecting them when she
                was only 8, her uncle had a small collection in his shed. Since
                then she has inherited this collection and extended it to almost
                500 different bottles of varying ages. When you see her, ask
                about it, she can talk for hours once you get her going!

              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>
                Born in Harlow – although we don’t hold that against him – in
                1991. When he is not being our design and metalwork guru, Jon is
                often found restoring his old VW Crossover Bay window Campervan,
                or at the riding stables with his young family. He loves the
                smell of spray paint and grease and often heard saying, “Pass
                the spanner.” Jon loves his job and the team he works with, but
                most of all, he loves sitting in the local Turkish restaurant
                with the team. It reminds him of the three years he worked in
                Turkey with an artisan blacksmith, whilst living in a cow shed
                of all places.

                Also born in London, born in 1995, the baby of the team.
                Supremely organised Kate literally runs the show. She is the go
                to person for any administration queries and also the best
                carpenter we have ever met. Alongside her studies at Colchester
                School of Arts she also studied woodwork and joinery, having
                already spent years working in the shed at the bottom of the
                garden, producing bespoke furniture and selling it locally with
                her father. She comes from a long line of creative people; some
                things are just in the blood. She loves long walks with her
                three dogs; they can often be seen asleep in our reception. Kate
                tells us, “it’s invaluable time to empty my mind when I am walk,
                I often consider how to get the most out of a unique piece of
                furniture or a cherished possession entrusted with us to create
                a memory that lasts forever”.
